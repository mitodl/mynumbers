## Local Development

This is a Vite-built React library. You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
(v18+).

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the Vite dev server for local inspection
npm run dev
```

Vite prints the local URL (typically http://localhost:5173).


## Using ARITHMIX as a library

The game and explainer can be embedded in another app. `npm run build`
produces an ESM + UMD bundle (`dist/lib`) with type declarations.
`react`, `react-dom`, `@emotion/react`, and `@emotion/styled` are peer
dependencies that the host app provides.

React host:

```tsx
import { Arithmix, GamePage, ExplainerPage } from "arithmix"

// Full app with built-in routing between the game and explainer:
<Arithmix />

// Or embed an individual page:
<GamePage />
<ExplainerPage />
```
